## Wine quality Dataset

In this project, we try to work on [Wine quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). This project was used to explore different classification models in matlab.

The final matlab file is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Wine-quality-dataset/blob/master/winequality.m) for this project and rendered html file is [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/abishekarun/Wine-quality-dataset/blob/master/html/winequality.html).

The resources that helped me are:

+ [Classification](https://in.mathworks.com/help/stats/examples/classification.html)
+ [Examples](https://in.mathworks.com/help/stats/examples.html)
+ [Machine learning in matlab](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/csc2515/matlab2.pdf)
